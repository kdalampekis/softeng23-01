## Attention
We encountered a problem trying to upload the ai logs. More specifically, we were not aware that we should save the ai logs and insert them in the github repo, so we uploaded them to galileo a while ago and we couldnt find the ai logs that are missing (5 ai logs). So dexpite having made 30 ai records in galileo, 5 of them couldnt be found. I hope they can be found by searching our team's number.
